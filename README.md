# End Gun Violence

Database of online resources to educate ourselves about gun violence in America, to donate to foundations fighting against gun violence and funds to support victims of gun violence, and to support each other as we navigate through this crisis.

I will continue to update this page. Please contact me with resources I may be missing. Thank you.
